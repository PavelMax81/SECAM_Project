# Type of interaction of boundary cells with neighbours:
# 0 - boundary cell does not change mechanical energy because of interaction with neighbours;
# 1 - boundary cell changes mechanical energy because of interaction with inner neighbour cells only;
# 2 - boundary cell changes mechanical energy because of interaction with each neighbour cell.
bound_interaction_type = 2

# Type of functional dependence of boundary cell parameter on its coordinates
